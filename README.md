## Brief

### Project Scope

SFIA 3 is a group project that will enforce agile methodologies. The aim is to address the need to address a Help queuing collection application to be used in the academy as a training aid tool. The application is to be developed with full CRUD functionality and two features of the development team's choice. Additionally a full CI pipeline to integrate and deploy new code to showcase continuous integration.

## Planning

### Jira Board

The project was planned using Atlassian Jira board. The type of planning board used was a Scrum board. Scrum boards use sprints, designed to focus the work on tasks and user stories and provide a sense of progression through. The picture below shows the current state of sprint that is being completed. After this MVP will be reached.

### Website Design

This image show the creation of a wire frame, that laid the foundation for the website site design. The wire frame allowed for the devlopment of the react app to be able to split the application into components, this plan made it clear as to how the data should be imported, either usind states or props. The image below the wire frame shows how the application looks on the frontend.

### AWS Infrastructure

There are two subnets in a VPC. The public subnet contains the bastion host, that allows devlopers to connect to the instances running on the private subenet.
The three EC2 instances running in the private subnet are the Jenkins Server, test VM and the arifact repository. These EC2 instance are able to connect to 
the internet via the NAT gateway, which always outboud traffic but doesn't allow inbound traffic. The NACL provides sercurity to the subnets by restricting traffic.

## CI-Pipeline

## Provisioning Services using Ansible

The project requires the use of ansible to configure services.  Once Terraform has been provisioned the Virtual Machines (VM), Ansible then sshâ€™s into the the VM for Jenkins and configures it in such a way that the set up wizard is  bypassed and and a user is automatically created. This step helped in saving time during the whole CI pipeline process.

## The use of Nexus

![](images/Nexus-private-repo.png)

In the CI-pipeline we build images for frontend and backend for the application and then push to the NEXUS private repository for safe keeping. The picture above shows successful push of images to the private repository.

|Implementation of new technologies and software|New Software and Technologies are constantly being rolled out and implemented into projects. This can be a risk due to the fact that the Software is yet to be tried and tested thoroughly throughout multiple projects. As a result of this errors can be encountered when implementing the new Software which may result in data loss or delays in development.|4                                             |7             |Development Team   |Ensure that if the development team are considering implementing any new Software or Technologies that they have researched them to see if they will integrate with the current project and doesn't have any reported issues with reliability or performance.|1                                                             |6                                                                                                                                                          |
|Untrained in React                            |Development team has some but not too much experience with react, meaning mistakes could be made that could possibly be detrimental to the project                                            |3                                             |7             |Development Team   |The development team is to undergo training so that they can improve their knowledge of act.

|Mis-communication resulting in redundant code |If there is not clear communication between the developers, this can lead to members working on the same area of the project and producing the same code twice which will end up being redundant and a waste of time. This could halt the progress of the project and cause a delay in the sprint.|5                                             |7             |Development Team   |The development team should ensure they are present for every daily stand up and are in constant communication to inform the rest of the team what they are currently working on to ensure everyone is clear on who is undertaking which task            |2                                                             |7                                                                                                                                                          |
|Poor coding practices                         |During development, if there isn't a clear formatting/code structure, the readability of the code can be very poor, especially for anybody new trying to read and understand the code.

If team members are unable to work together move the team members to different roles within the project. If team members need to work on same part of the project try to resolve issues between team members with team mediation. If this fails then move the team members to a silo work structure so the work they have to complete together will be minimal.|2                                                      |10                                                                                                                                                         |

|Skewed Influence over Decisions               |A team member may not feel listen to and their ideas are not being taken seriously. This will lead to that team member not being motivated to complete the project to the best of their ability or moving to harm the success of the project.|4                                             |8             |Team 4             |Make sure everyone has chance to give input on their topic and make sure that dominant personalities within the group are reminded of the agile mind set and to always listen. Playing planning poker will give team members that may have a different point of view on things chance to speak up and voice there concerns.|1                                                      |5                                                                                                                                                          |

IF both team member in the DevOps and the Software engineering team feel as if they do not understand what they are doing properly the protocol to follow is to redo the modules on the QA web page and then complete a course on cloud academy so that they can ascertain an understanding of the topic. There are tests on Cloud Academy for the team member to assess their skill level objectively.|8                                                      |2                                                                                                                                                          |
|Groupthink                                    |This occurs when team members don't speak up when consensus of the team is to implement or complete a task in a certain way than they think is the best possible way.                        |9                                             |10            |Team 4             |Planning poker will mitigate the risk to a certain degree so that when a team member feels differently on a topic they won't have a team consensus before making their decision. This will lead to the individual providing reason as to why they believe a task should be done a certain way. Team members are also reminded that the they should always voice their opinion if they think the plan or tactic is incorrect or will lead to security issues |7                                                      |2                                                                                                                                                          |
